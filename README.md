# Nekter-Energy-Drink-Dashboard.

This project shows the use of Power Query and DAX Query to analyse the food delivery data, add new measures and columns, and create a dashboard using Power BI.

## Objective 
To provide consumers with a refreshing and energizing beverage that combines great taste with natural ingredients, while promoting an active and healthy lifestyle.

### Tools Used
* Power BI
* Power Query
* Dax Query
* Data modeling

#### Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query
- Open Excel and connect to your Food delivery data
- Use Power Query to clean and transform the data
- Create a copy template for one sheet in Power Query transformations and apply the same transformations to all sheets
- Apply all necessary cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types (As it is a clean data, I have skipped this step)
- Create a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition
- Encapsulate all steps into a function to be reused for future sheets and data
- Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI

### Exploring and Manipulate Some Data Using DAX Query
* With DAX Query, we can effectively manipulate and analyse the data to provide insights for visualization and identify areas for improvement for HR.
* Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum, calculate, if, switch, divide and Date-time function for exploring some clean data for improve dashboard KPI in PowerBI.



### Custom Forecasting-Explore advanced forecasting models under the "Modeling" tab

### Power BI Dashboard Visualization
* Design the dashboard layout
* Create a measure table to aggregate and display the data using Dax functions
* Use Visualization for charts and filters for filter dashboard
* Now, Add Title Food Delivery Forecast Dashboard
* Add Year column as Slicer and add some informative KPI.
